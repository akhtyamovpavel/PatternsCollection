# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
